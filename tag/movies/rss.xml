There's sure to be at least a couple that are on everyone's radar, but with such a vast array of movies coming up, it's easy to miss out on a few. So for easy reference, here are some of the upcoming movie releases in 2017 that ooze potential, and have our curiosities piqued. <br/>(Note: This is not a comprehensive list, just some of the ones that I'm personally anticipating.)</p>
                <p class="instructions">
                    Hover over each movie, to see why you should be excited and to view the trailers (where available). You can also filter the movies by genre or popularity, and sort by release date or my level of anticipation.

            <p class="release">2 June 2017</p>
            <p class="level">01</p>
            <span>My number 1 most anticipated movie of the year. Gal Gadot headlines the first standalone female superhero movie of the current era. The weight of the future of the DCEU rests on her shoulders, but I believe Wonder Woman will achieve the greatness she deserves. </span>

            <p class="level">02</p>
            <span>Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Green Lanternâ€¦ the list goes on. Probably the greatest collection of superheroes to ever be assembled in one movie, Justice League would really have to work a miracle to not be entertaining.

            <p class="level">03</p>
            <span>Supposedly Hugh Jackman's last outing as everyone's favourite mutant, Wolverine returns to the big-screen with a very different kind of superhero movie. The tone looks grim, and decidedly violent, but intermixed with drama and heavy emotional undertones. Also keep an eye out for the introduction of the next incarnation of Wolverine.

            <p class="level">14</p>
            <span>A harrowing look at the horrors of war through the lense of Christopher Nolan, director of the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. If you're a fan of Saving Private Ryan, something tells me, you're going to be a fan of Dunkirk as well.

            <p class="level">24</p>
            <span>The next chapter in the Alien saga, with director Ridley Scott returning to the helm, Alien Covenant looks to deliver a quality sci-fi horror movie, as it continuing the story introduced in Prometheus.

            <p class="level">08</p>
            <span>Thor vs The Hulk. We got a slight taste of it in The Avengers, but get ready to see it on a whole new level, when the two goliaths face-off gladiator style, in what's sure to be a crazy, action-packed movie. I don't know how they're gonna pull it off, but I'm definitely curious to see them try.</span>

            <p class="release">15 December 2017</p>
            <p class="level">06</p>
            <span>The Skywalker Chronicles continue! It doesn't take a lot of convincing to get on board with the latest episode of Star Wars, especially coming on the heels of the triumphant Rogue One. More Luke Skywalker, can only mean good things. It will also likely be the last time we see Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia, so it will certainly be an emotional day at the theatre.

            <p class="level">21</p>
            <span>A somewhat quirky-looking sci-fi adventure, with a ton of incredible visuals, I don't know much about Valerian, but I'm curious to learn more. Can Cara Delevingne finally prove once and for all that she's a legitimate actress, and help us all forget that awful dancey performance in Suicide Squad?</span>

            <p class="release">3 February 2017</p>
            <p class="level">26</p>
            <span>Imagine discovering the world for the very first time as a teenager. The Space Between Us has the interesting premise, of a boy, born on a space station on Mars, away from almost all human contact. As he journeys to Earth for the first time, the film explores new encounters, falling in love, and discovering your place in the world. </span>

            <p class="level">12</p>
            <span>Repeating the same day over and over again is hardly a new premise for a movie. But Before I Fall isn't a flashy sci-fi action blockbuster. It's a quiet indie film, where one girl, while in the process of being doomed to repeat the same day again and again, must discover how even the smallest, most mundane moments can shape the course of the future, and to make every second count.</span>

            <p class="level">15</p>
            <span>King Kong is back! And he's bigger than ever! Kong Skull Island will take us back to the 80s where we'll be introduced to the biggest incarnation of King Kong that we've seen yet. Why is he so big? Because, if all goes well, he'll be battling Godzilla on the big screen in the not too distant future. Also, the movie stars Tom Hiddleston, so that should be enough of a draw.

            <p class="level">05</p>
            <span>Yet another reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this time with Marvel onboard. While we should all be sorely tired of seeing yet another new iteration of the character, Spiderman Homecoming managed to do the impossible; it actually got me excited for it, with a charming and entertaining trailer, that somehow breathed new life into the character.

            <p class="level">04</p>
            <span>Emma Watson and Dan Stevens bring the animated classic to life. Even if you've never seen the original animated Disney flick, the beautiful visuals, enchanting music, and a chance to see Hermione as Belle, is reason enough to look forward to Beauty and the Beast.

            <p class="release">10 February 2017</p>
            <p class="level">16</p>
            <span>Just when we'd all settled on Batman as the darkest, most serious superhero ever, here come the Lego Batman Movie, to show us a completely different take on the Dark Knight. The trailers have been hilarious, poking fun at the stoic and dark nature of the character, with even a little jab at Batman v Superman. It looks to be a fun and entertaining movie going experience.

            <p class="level">10</p>
            <span>This brand new iteration of the Power Rangers seems to be oozing with cheese, but when you're talking about 5 teens who dress up in colourful super suits and fight monsters, it's pretty hard to avoid cheesiness. If you're willing to forgive the campiness, it just might be a fun call-back to your childhood. The special effects look cool enough.

            <p class="release">6 October 2017</p>
            <p class="level">09</p>
            <span>The first Kingsman movie was a wildly entertaining action film. With tons of fun parodies of typical spy genre tropes, along with some truly spectacular action scenes, it was a standout movie. If this sequel can be even half as entertaining as its predecessor, then count me in. Manners maketh a man!

            <p class="release">9 June 2017</p>
            <p class="level">22</p>
            <span>Forget the goofy action comedy of the last decade. This is a reboot of the franchise, with Tom Cruise along for the ride. Will it be Mission Impossible with Mummies? Perhaps. But how could that possibly be a bad thing. Also, this time we'll be dealing with a female version of the monster.

            <p class="level">11</p>
            <span>Charlie Hunnam stars as the titular character in this origin-story of sorts. It doesn't look like any Arthurian tale we've ever seen before, and considering that this is from Guy Richie, the director of the Sherlock Holmes films and last year's criminally underrated Man from UNCLE, King Arthur Legend of the Sword looks to a movie worth seeing.

            <span>Any movie with Emma Watson has my attention. Throw in a plot of a nefarious Tech company that seems to be crossing the line of user privacy, the movie looks to be a timely exploration of some of the issues our society is facing today.</span>

            <span>Scarlette Johanson stars in Ghost in the Shell, a science-fiction movie adapted from a famous Japanese Manga of the same name. I'm not familiar with the original property, but the visuals look stunning, and the cinematic universe explored in the movie, seems intriguing enough to give it a watch.

            <p class="level">28</p>
            <span>The Belko Experiment is one of those movies that makes you question, "what would you do if you were in that situation?" It's a horrifying premise, being trapped with your co-workers and being told to choose who lives and dies. It's sure to raise questions of morality vs survival, and it has Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn at the helm.</span>

            <span>Chris Evans takes a break from being everyone's favourite Captain, to play a young man raising his niece who is a child-prodigy. It's nice to see Chris Evans outside of an action role, and Gifted looks to be a touching and heart-warming tale of redemption, trust and family.</span>

            <span>The Pirates franchise doesn't quite excite us like it used to, but there's hope for Dead Men Tell No Tales, as it sees the return of Orlando Bloom, and hopefully a return to a tighter storyline focusing on characters we care about.

Alien life threatening a space-crew isn't exactly a novel concept, but the trailer and the cast involved make this a movie worth getting excited about.</span>

            <p class="release">7 April 2017</p>
            <p class="level">14</p>
            <span>If Dunkirk is a little too intense for you, Their Finest examines World War 2 through a different perspective. A female screen-writer in a British film crew, must overcome stereotypes and discrimination to do her part to help in the war. While the movie is set in a difficult period, it presents a heart-warming and comic side to the story, that should make it accessible to everyone, with charming performances by Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin and Bill Nighy.</span>

            <span>If you like your Jane Austen stories with a darker flavour, then My Cousin Rachel looks to be right up your alley. Based on the popular Daphne Du Maurier novel, the film stars Sam Claflin and Rachel Weiz in a mysterious and twisted love story. I haven't read the novel, but the trailer alone has me curious about this story.</span>

            <span>The Lost City of Z revolves around the real-life story of a British explorer on his search for a forgotten city in the depths of the amazon. The movie looks to blend adventure with the eeriness of the unknown, and stars Carlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson, who just happens to be sporting a glorious beard. Uncharted territory indeed.</span>

                    Rogue One is exactly what its subtitle suggests; a story based in the Star Wars universe. It sits between Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) and Episode IV (A New Hope). In fact, it literally tells the story of the first couple of lines in the Opening Crawl of Episode IV.</p>

                <p>In summary, Rogue One is the tale of rag-tag members of a fledgling Rebel Alliance coming together to steal the plans to the Galactic Empire's superweapon, The Deathstar. It acts as the launching pad for the events that lead to the final take-down of Empire, and fleshes out the entire Star Wars universe in a very satisfying way. Indeed it's a brilliant achievement on the part of this film, that it takes one line of exposition, and turns it into a well-rounded and entertaining story.</p>

                            While the movie centers on the rebels, the primary focus rests on Jyn Erso, played by a quietly strong Felicity Jones, a young woman who is haunted by her family's connection to the Empire. She is supported by strong performances from Diego Luna as Captain Cassian Andor, Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe and Ben Mendelsohn as the deliciously villainous Orson Krennic. There are many other famous faces and engaging performances scattered throughout the film, and as a whole the cast gels well together to bring us, what is easily, the most diverse Star Wars movie we have ever seen.

                 <p>There are electric moments of chemistry between the cast members, be it a deep rooted friendship between Chirrut and Baze, or the palpable sexual tension between Jyn and Cassian. It's been awhile since I saw a movie where the male and female lead donâ€™t share a single on-screen kiss, and yet have as much chemistry as Felicity Jones and Diego Luna.</p>

His witty and sarcastic remarks, delivered in Tudyk's dead-pan matter-of-fact tone of voice, had the theatre audience laughing out loud.

                            The action is well choreographed, and feels dangerous. In an age where nearly every action movie borrows from the school of Jason Bourne's quick-cut mayhem, it's wonderful to see the action through steady, long-held camera shots. It allows us to truly appreciate each moment of choreography. Donnie Yen especially lends a sense of believability to his action scenes, as he obviously knows what he's doing. The movie as a whole divides its action into two halves, where the first hour of the film has more close-quartered action, while the final hour moves to a grander scale with epic space battles. Both are handled exceptionally well.</p>

                        <p>
                            The great thing about Rogue One is that you can go in as a complete Star Wars noob, and still have a fairly enjoyable movie-going experience, because it stands on its own as a well-constructed story. But if you're familiar with Star Wars lore, and if you've watched the previous movies, you're going to be positively gleeful. It has numerous appearances by familiar faces throughout the Star Wars anthology, and it perfectly bridges together the Prequels with the Original Trilogy. While Hollywood has been overrun with sequels/prequels/reboots that all try their best to play on our nostalgia, Rogue One has done it the best so far. Beyond merely referencing an existing franchise, it actually builds on it and improves it.</p>

                           If you've seen the trailer, then it should come as no surprise to you that Darth Vader makes an appearance in this movie. He's not in it extensively, but his presence is definitely felt in a powerful way. No spoilers, but there's a scene towards the end of the movie involving Lord Vader that was simply breath-taking. I've been a casual Star Wars fan for a long time, and I've watched every movie in the series, but I never really understood why Darth Vader was often considered the number 1 villain in movie history. I never really understood the menace or fear that the characters in the movies seemed to feel in his presence. That was until I saw Rogue One. Once you see the movie, you'll understand.

                            Rogue One is action-packed, engaging and thoroughly entertaining. Some viewers might find the first half of the movie a little slow-moving, but the pay-off at the end is well-worth it.  I'm going to say something a little controversial here; but understand that I didn't grow up with the original trilogy and I found the prequels somewhat lacking. Episode VII: The Force Awakens was a fun ride and I definitely enjoyed it. But the thing is Rogue One just might be my favourite Star Wars movie.

                    Movies based on Video Games have established a well-proven stereotype; shallow, campy, over-the-top and almost always, disappointing. They've ranged from low-budget cheesiness like Mortal Kombat, to big-budget star-driven wanna-be epics like Prince of Persia. </p>
                <p>
                    Warcraft had every chance to follow in those exact same footsteps, and when initially presented with its world, it may seem like more of the same shallow, effects-driven fan-service that we've seen before. But after seeing the movie, I'm extremely happy to conclude that this was without a doubt, the best Video Game Movie that I have seen thus far. </p>

                            As a precursor, I admit that I haven't played the World of Warcraft game, that the movie is based off of. I have however played Warcraft 3, the real-time strategy incarnation of the game. The characters in this movie were all new to me, so I didn't have much fore-knowledge going into the movie.</p>

                            Warcraft tells the story of a first encounter between two very different civilizations; the Orcs and Humans. Each race has its own dynamics and culture, which are very much at odds with each other, which in turn sparks a war. The Orcs are the instigators, while the Humans are merely reactionary.</p>
                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">
                            In these instances, we're mostly used to seeing stories told from the Human perspective. If there's an Alien Invasion, it's from the Human perspective. If there's a battle against some supernatural force, it's from the Human perspective. Even prior fantasy stories, such as Lord of the Rings are mostly based around the perspective of human or human-like races. In fact, we've gotten pretty used to seeing Orcs as mindless beasts who are only interested in death and destruction. </p>

                            Warcraft breaks this trend, by making the Orcs the most compelling characters onscreen. They have internal conflicts, wavering loyalties, intricate tribal traditions and hierarchies, and a deep sense of honour. They do reign a fair amount of chaos on the Human world, leaving destruction in their wake, but no one could accuse these creatures of being unthinking beasts. Even the introduction to our primary Orc protagonist, war-chieftain Durotan, is by his pregnant wife's side, as they playfully discuss their future child. This paints a very different picture from the Orcs that we've grown accustomed to seeing, and it is truly refreshing.</p>

                            The majority of the character development throughout the movie remains with the Orcs. There are moments where we delve into the human characters and get a glimpse of their own histories and motivations, but this is minimal and can sometimes even seem a little flat in comparison.</p>
                        <p>This movie is really about the story of Durotan and his people's journey to find a home. I wonder if the majority of the criticism that has been levelled at this movie is due to the fact that the usual "heroes" are less compelling than the brutish creatures. This is a fresh take on Fantasy, and the Video Game movie genre as a whole, so I found myself pleasantly surprised.</p>

                            It would do this film a great disservice if I didn't mention the epic, yes absolutely EPIC battle sequences it depicts. Director Duncan Jones expertly captures the action up-close without it ever feeling muddled or confusing. You feel the weight of every hammer's fall, and the sharpness of each sword. The action scenes were exceedingly entertaining, and sometimes I found myself even cringing whenever a particularly heavy blow would fall. It felt like being in the middle of the fight, and even if you see this movie just for the action, I believe it would be time well-spent.</p>

                    <p>A note on Paula Patton's character, Garona, a half-breed Orc character; throughout the marketing campaign for the movie, she was shown in Orc garb, which was quite revealing, while she struck a provocative pose. Now I understand that the target audience of this movie is primarily made up of the younger male demographic, so Hollywood was just being Hollywood by marketing her character that way. It's an annoying aspect of the entertainment industry in general, but it is what it is.  As I watched the movie however, I was pleasantly surprised to see that as the story progressed, Garona became more "clothed" if I could use that term. Her character wasn't just eye-candy. She got full-bodied armour, she fought viciously in battle, she integrated into a new society, and she dealt with several emotional storylines. The final act of the movie even hinted that she may have an even more important role to play should the series continue in the future. All in all, it was exceedingly refreshing to see an intelligent portrayal of a female character in a video game movie.</p>

                            The sceneries and environment are expansive and breath-taking. It often feels surreal; like a painting brought to life. This feeling invades the whole look of the movie, where it may feel like you are in the middle of a Video Game rather than a traditional movie environment. Movies tend to always lean towards some sense realism, even when depicting Fantasy worlds. But Warcraft lets go of realism, and fully embraces the largeness of its universe. It could have easily been quite cheesy, but Duncan Jones handles it with such finesse that keeps it within a sense of wonderment, rather than incredulity.</p>

                <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">
                    All in all, Warcraft deals with the traditional notions of Light vs Darkness, Good vs Evil, Tradition vs New-Thinking. It also explores deeper themes of loyalty, friendship, bravery and finding one's place in the world. The film boasts fantastic special effects, and the motion capture work on the Orcs is remarkable. It breaks norms, in making the "ugly beasts" the main focus of the film, and gives its characters intelligent and compelling story arcs. So despite what the majority of film critics seem to think, the thing is, Warcraft is the best Video Game Movie thus far, at least in my opinion.</p>

But even he is not introduced as a confident and established hero, but as a grimy and weatherworn Ranger. Beneath the mud and grime however, is a leader of men and the heir to the throne of Gondor. Aragorn struggles with self-doubt, but eventually overcomes his insecurities to claim his destiny as a great warrior, leading a great host against the enemy, and finally being crowned as king. By all means, this is the Hero's journey that we have come to expect.</p>
                    <p>
                        But anyone who has delved into the Lord of the Rings, would probably not point to Aragorn as the primary Hero of the tale. He certainly is one of the many heroes in the series, yet somehow, despite being the quintessential personification of heroism, it is the characters that surprise us that seem to have the greater impact in the course of the story.

                        The Unexpected Hero is a recurring theme in The Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien begins this with Frodo Baggins. Much is made of a simple hobbit being chosen as the Ring Bearer, amidst the presence of warriors, wizards and wise men. Frodo never sees himself playing a large or even significant role, merely a temporary steward of the Ring until stronger and wiser folk can take over. And yet it is he that becomes the bearer of the greatest burden, precisely because of his humility and unassuming nature. It harkens to the famous adage that perhaps the greatest Heroes are the ones that do not pursue its glories.

                        Once Frodo becomes the Ring Bearer, we settle in for a charming story of how our brave little Hobbit will overcome his trials to defeat the evil forces that surround him and triumph as the ultimate Hero. We are now one step into the Unexpected Hero theme. But as the plot progresses, events do not unfold the way we expect. Despite being pure-hearted and good-intentioned, Frodo progressively crumbles under the burden of being the Ring Bearer. Despite being essentially our main protagonist, by the latter-end of the tale, he makes unwise decisions, treats Sam unfairly, is undiscerning of Gollum's treachery, and finally is unable to resist the temptation of the One Ring, succumbing to his desire and deciding to hold on to it instead of destroying it. That, is certainly not heroic. Now we are pulled in one step deeper into the twist of the Unexpected Hero. As Frodo steadily shrinks in heroism, Tolkien introduces to us another.

                        Samwise Gamgee is presented to us as the "stupid, fat hobbit". The sidekick to the story. At least, an insignificant companion to the Fellowship, and at best, a support system for our main protagonist. He certainly doesn't fit the bill of a Hero, and we never expect him to be one. But by the end of the story, it is indeed Sam who emerges as the Hero. It is Sam who wades into the river to follow his master into Mordor, refusing to let him go alone. Sam, who sacrifices his rations for Frodo's sake, going hungry at times during their difficult journey. Sam, who remains loyal to their friendship despite the seeds of discord sown by Gollum. Sam, who faces his fears and risks everything to fight the monstrous spider, Shelob, and confronts a band of Orcs to rescue Frodo. And in perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of the tale, it is Sam who carries his friend up the side of Mount Doom, when Frodo has lost all will.

                        Other characters hold true to this theme as well. Merry and Pippin are introduced as mischief-makers, and the comic relief of the series. However, by the end, Merry has ridden into battle with the army of Rohan, and bravely stabs the Lord of the NazgÃ»l, thus enabling Eowyn to vanquish him. And Pippin has gone from being an incessant annoyance, and the thorn in Gandalf's side, to being a Guard of the Citadel of Gondor, helping Gandalf to save Faramir's life from the insanity of his father and even fighting in the army during the final assault on the Gates of Mordor. Eowyn is presented as a shieldmaiden of Rohan, constantly left behind as the men of her kingdom ride to battle, and seemingly relegated to being an unfortunate and rejected love-interest for Aragorn. But she rises above these circumstances to fight in the battle of the Pelennor Fields, and finally defeat the Witch King of Angmar, doing what even Aragorn and Gandalf could not do.</p>

                    <p>Tolkien births an important idea in our minds; that a Hero does not always begin his journey as one.

                        <p>The one thing that you must know, when going in to see Disney's latest movie, The Jungle Book, is that 95% of what you see is entirely computer generated. The reason you should know this going in, is because 5 minutes into the film, you're going to completely forget that fact. And that is precisely what makes this a movie worth watching.</p>

                        <h2>Story</h2>
                        <p>As far as story goes, there isn't a lot that's going on. The plot follows Mowgli as he makes the journey across the jungle on his quest to reach the "man village." Along the way he crosses a myriad of environments and encounters various wildlife, some friendly, and some not so much. The overall story arc is quite predictable, and delivers pretty much the plot you would expect. Good triumphs over evil of course, our main protagonist being the beacon of hope and the voice that rallies everyone together. </p>

                        <p>Despite this however, the movie manages to keep its viewer engaged, not so much because we are ever in suspense as to whether Mowgli will eventually triumph, but because we are so invested in the environment and the captivating world that we see. We care about Mowgli, and more impressively, the movie makes us care about the CGI animals as well.

                            <p>CGI Technology continues to make impressive leaps and bounds in creating worlds that do not exist and making them wholly believable to viewers. This is often easier when the world being created is something of fantasy and science-fiction, an alien world or a mythical creature. But when CGI can authentically mimic things that we are essentially familiar with, then it deserves special praise. This is the case in The Jungle Book. Although the idea of talking animals and a human child living alongside them and communicating with them is a branch of fantasy, the appearance, movements and behaviour of the animals are all based upon reality.

It becomes easy to imagine that the child actor is really caressing the course fur of a real trained Wolf or Jaguar, or is riding on the belly of a real trained Bear. But he isn't. In reality, he's interacting with a static figure covered in blue felt on the end of a stick. </p>

                    <h2>Acting</h2>
                    <p  data-scroll-reveal="enter from the left after 0.2s">While the CGI Animators deserve high praise for the authenticity of the world that is presented in the movie, the burden of driving the emotional connection we feel to it, is borne almost entirely by the young star of the movie, Neel Sethi. He makes the difference of it not being merely a visually stunning and believable environment, but one that we get emotionally invested in, with characters that we care about. It certainly is an impressive feat when you consider that this is his first feature film and he was a mere 10 years old during filming. His acting is mostly convincing, and never exaggerated, and any moments where it is evident that he is acting are easily forgiven when the camera catches his deep engaging gaze. Also, it doesn't hurt that he is incredibly adorable and feels like the mischievous little brother we all wish we had.</p>

                    <p>
                        The movie also boasts a powerhouse voice-acting cast; of these the most recognizable voices provided by Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong'o, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken. Bill Murray especially shines as the lovable Baloo and steals the show whenever he's on screen (or should I say, whenever his voice is heard). The comedy is ever present, while being grounded somewhat to make it more believable, but anyone would be hard-pressed to not immediately fall in love with that silly bear. Scarlet Johansson is also quite notable, and despite having a smaller role, completely consumes the screen time as the sinister snake Kaa. Idris Elba also delivers a commanding performance as the fearsome tiger Shere Khan.

            There's a great tension in the deeper story of The Jungle Book, especially in terms of the character motivations. There are compelling themes of family and friendship, but I found a more complex theme behind Shere Khan's motivations. There is no doubt that he is the essential antagonist of the story, and painted on the surface as the typical villain. But upon reflection, one has to wonder whether his qualms about Mowgli were not unfounded. His prior experience with man has been as that of an invader and a disruptor of the natural way of the jungle. Man brings with him the "red flower", fire that destroys everything it touches. In fact, all the animals of the jungle fear it for this very reason, and so rightly they should. </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Jungle Book is a thrilling adventure film, which captivates its audience with stunning environments, amazing renderings of nature and compelling characters. The story is nothing new and won't deliver much in terms of surprises and plot twists, but The Thing is, the movie still manages to engage its viewers right to the end based on the strength of its incredible visual effects and effective performances.

<p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the top after 0.2s"><span class="italic">Just on a side note;</span> several months ago, during the height of my anticipation for the then upcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice movie, a funny realization struck me. Clark Kent's mother is named Martha Kent. And Bruce Wayne's mother is named Martha Wayne. I was marveling (no pun intended), that two of DC Comics' greatest heroes have mothers with the exact same first name. I even joked about it with friends, saying 'you would think that they would have at least tried to find different names for such prominent characters in the story.' I mildly wondered to myself if they would have to awkwardly shrug that off in the film and make it not seem like such a blaring coincidence. Never in a million years did I think that that one idea would end up being the lynch pin for the events in BvS. </p>

<p>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was probably the most unique movie I have ever seen in the superhero genre. I cannot with a clear conscience say that it was the best superhero movie I have ever seen. But without a doubt, it was the superhero movie that made me think the most. Walking out of the theatre, my mind was reeling with a plethora of mysteries, plot points, character arcs and questions. Sitting in the theatre, I hardly had time to process one scene of intense character drama, before I was whisked away to another scene of epic special effects, before cutting into yet another scene of dense philosophical discussion. I couldnâ€™t switch my brain off for even a second, because even a spectacular fight sequence was crafted with such care and detail, that there were dozens of appreciable elements floating in the nooks and crannies of the scene. Sometimes the editing even felt jarring and erratic. </p>
<p>There was just too much to be seen, there was just so much of this world to be explored, and if I blinked I would miss it. So I soaked it all in. BvS kept me on my toes the entire timeâ€¦ <span class="italic">and this was a good thing.</span>

<p>As a general rule I have appreciated almost all comic book movie adaptations (I could even appreciate the bold choices in the most recent Fantastic Four movie/disaster, even if that movie was so fatally flawed). But I believe to a certain extent, any Superhero movie that succeeded in the world of audiences and critics, has followed a similar formula; a certain flavor sprinkled throughout that makes it universally accessible. Have a linear story to follow. Focus on only a few central plots. Throw in some easter eggs for the die-hard fans. And levity. Lots of levity. Even in the aftermath of the world literally crashing down around our heroes, they're in the mood for shawarma. Key to success: Have. Plenty. Of. Levity.

<p>Batman v Superman breaks pretty much all these rules. It's story is non-linear, jumping without warning between the past and the present, dreams and reality. It juggles a multitude of plots varying in size and significance. It's stuffed full of nods to comic fans, that left most general audiences scratching their heads.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>And as for levity... well, I suppose Lex Luthor was a little comedic? No? Maybe? No?</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>The characters felt mature and had depth. Everyone seemed to be haunted by something. Batman, with the loss of his parents, his morals, his hope. Superman, with the consequences and guilt of his attempts at heroism. Lex Luthor, with the psychological trauma caused by his father and the cynicism of God and power. Wonder Woman, with the loss of her faith in the good of humanity. Even the ordinary people of society were dealing with the aftermath of the events of Man of Steel, and divisive views of Superman. So much personal baggage was woven throughout this movie; some blatantly obvious (Bruce Wayne haunted by his parent's death), some merely hinted at in snatches of dialogue (Lex offhandedly referencing his difficult childhood with his father). Everyone felt real, especially mankind's polarizing response to Superman's presence. Let's be real, if a superhuman alien showed up in our world today, a good portion of the population would respond with suspicion and fear, and they would be justified in doing so. Despite all the mythic grandeur of this movie, the people it depicted felt surprisingly grounded.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>
<p>The action was like watching motion art. Brutal fight scenes were difficult to watch but at the same time transfixing in their sheer fluidity and beauty. Each battle had its own visual style that captured the atmosphere of the situation. Batman's fight with two dozen thugs felt tight and up-close to the camera, brutal to the point that we could feel the pain of each punch. The namesake fight between Superman and Batman was more spread out over various environments and surroundings as the heroes pushed and threw each other around with furiosity. The final battle with Doomsday was the very definition of epic with each hero bringing their own fighting style and skills to the match. It was nothing short of gleeful to see Wonder Woman take the lead in aggressively attacking Doomsday and showing her prowess as a centuries-old warrior.</p>

<div class="col-sm-12" data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>But what captivated me most about BvS, was the story arc of the characters. Especially the main two. Batman started as a jaded, wasted, shell of a man, brutally branding the criminals he apprehends, and outright refusing to see any good in the world around him, most specifically in Superman. Superman for his part was struggling with the increasing doubt as to his true purpose on earth, even as he felt the weight of guilt for his actions. He was torn between the responsibility of protecting the world around him while also protecting the only family he has left on this planet, the two women he loves; Martha Kent and Lois Lane.</p>
<p>While Batman and Superman were pitched as visual juxtapositions of each other, Day vs Night, the metaphor runs deeper. Batman is devoid of hope. Superman is the very embodiment of hope.</p>

<p>Batman only sees darkness in people, so he is blinded to the goodness of Superman. Superman on the other hand, is so willing to believe the best in people, that he fails to see the threat in them. This was masterfully captured in the senate explosion scene. The look of utter defeat and shame on Superman's face in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, showed his realization that his naive optimism had been his biggest hindrance. But by the end, Superman succeeds in being the ultimate beacon of light and hope, awakening hope in the dark shadows of Batman's life. The change in Batman from the beginning of the movie to the end is palpable. And that is perhaps Superman's greatest achievement in a movie titled Batman v Superman.</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6" data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">
<p>The acting in this movie was spectacular. Henry Cavill was brilliant as a layered and conflicted Superman that for once, we could all relate to. Ben Affleck shined as a beaten and brutal Batman. And Gal Gadot, while having minimal screen time, electrified every scene she was in.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>On a personal note, it felt amazing to see a woman in a superhero movie depicted with such grace, beauty and power, without being relegated to eye-candy and objectification to please the teenage fanboys. (ahem... Black Widow).

<h3>Other points of interest</h3>


<div class="row list">
<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Visuals</h4> Zack Snyder's knack for creating breathtaking visuals is evidenced throughout the movie. An exorbitant amount of attention to detail shines through, and scenes are shot in exciting perspectives and angles. There's are also heavy religious references throughout the movie; Superman obviously being a Christ-like figure. I noticed this especially in the scene where Superman's dead body is carefully handed down from a height by Batman to Wonder Woman, and is transferred to the lap of a weeping Lois Lane. It visually played out similarly to the Biblical moment when Jesus' body is brought down from the cross and lain in his mother Mary's lap. Powerful and captivating imagery.</div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Plot Twists</h4> Warner Bros. kind of screwed up by revealing too much of the movie's main beats in pre-release trailers. However, there were still a few moments in the movie that hit me out of nowhere. The explosion at the Senate for one (Granny's Peach Tea, anyone?). But in a much bigger way, the death of Superman at the end was completely unexpected and a bold move to make. Call Zack Snyder what you like, but a predictable storyteller he most certainly is not.
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Score</h4> Hanz Zimmer and Junkie XL have crafted a masterpiece of a score which truly becomes its own character in the movie. It was good to hear the epic and moving Superman theme from Man of Steel reprised, and Lex Luthor's theme expertly conveys the character's intrigue and overall creepiness. If there was such a thing as the quintessential comic supervillain theme, this would be it. But the standout track is without a doubt the Wonder Woman theme. I challenge anyone to listen to it and not feel like they could muster up the energy to break down a door; it's the definition of kick-ass.</div>

<p>In all honesty, it is mildly exhausting to watch BvS. Because it isn't a relaxing movie. It will not let its audience settle into any sort of comfort zone. Above all, it makes you think. And some people may not enjoy that in a superhero genre movie. And that's fair. But personally, it was refreshing to not have everything spelt out for me, and to have to infer the motivations and histories of characters. Yes BvS was exhausting, but it was exhausting like a great work-out that leaves you tired but energized. If there's one hallmark of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, it was that it was different, but the thing is... I loved that about it.</p>

Exaggeration and hyperbole aside, I can safely say that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is my most anticipated movie event of 2016. It's hard to believe that it's finally here. Early reviews are leaking through the sieve of Social Media, and everyone seems severely polarized on the topic. The Critics and Fans seem to be having their own showdown in terms of opinions on this movie. I am yet to see it, so this is purely based on my own opinion and speculation of the promotional material released for BvS. This is why I think it has the potential to rock...</p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-7">
<h2>01. Batfleck</h2>
<p>Despite what the rest of the internet has to say on the subject, I've always been a fan of Ben Affleck. I forgive him for the J-Lo phase (we all make mistakes), and he has certainly come a long way since 2003's Daredevil.</p> <p>Against all odds, and a bevy of naysayers, everyone seems to agree, this just might be the greatest movie incarnation of Batman we have ever seen. Utterly menacing and brutally bad-ass, this is the first Batman that I truly fear, and I mean that in a good way. I mean seriously, would you want to run into this guy in a dark alley? <span class="shudder"> ~ Shudder ~ </span></p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-7 pull-right">
<h2>02. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman</h2>
<p>Another casting choice that set the internet on fire, but she's sure done a 180, with early reviews hailing her as the best part of the movie, especially considering that she probably has a miniscule amount of screen time in comparison to her male superhero counterparts. I could write an entire article on why I think her casting alone is an important step forward for Hollywood, but I'll hold off on that till I've seen the movie. But rest assured, from what I've seen and heard so far, this woman is both beauty and beast in the best way possible.</p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-7">
<h2>03. Conflicted Superman</h2>
<p>
If I had to choose one thing that I liked about Man of Steel, I would say Henry Cavill. If I had to choose two, then the other would be that the Superman of that movie was more humanized than anything I had seen before. He made mistakes, he ran away from his powers, and he had realistic human parents who mentored him in exactly the way we would expect our parents to treat us if we suddenly manifested superhuman strength; with protective caution. The world is a scary place, and humans tend to be the worst thing about it, so it makes sense for Superman, as an outsider, to be weary and conflicted about how he goes about things. BvS is poised to bring us more depth in that aspect.

<h2>04. The Lex Luthor of today</h2>
<img src="assets/img/lex.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
<p>
It seems like almost every casting decision in this movie has been met with trepidation, and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is one that still hasn't proven itself to be bankable. But from what they've given us so far, it seems like this incarnation of the billionaire mastermind is moulded after what most modern billionaires look like today. Young, casual, socially awkward, unassuming enough that we would trust them with vast amounts of our personal informationâ€¦ remind you of anyone? (Zuckerâ€¦cough). And if that's the case, then who better to play this new Luthor than the very actor who is renowned for portraying one of the real-life billionaire masterminds of our generation.</p>

<h2>05. Action Action Action</h2>
<p>
Say what you want about Zach Snyder, but the man knows how to give us great action scenes. And from that Batman trailer sequence alone (you already know what I'm referring to, because yes it was that good), I think it's safe to expect beautiful and brutal action, which is what Zach Snyder excels at capturing (for evidence, see: 300).

Are there things that I'm anxious about regarding this movie? Sure. Trying to avoid critic reviews is like holding your breath; you can only do it for so long. Will this be a perfect movie? Highly unlikely. But the thing is, this is Batman v Superman; childhood heroes battling it out on the big-screen like we've never seen them before. Sure there might be things to gripe about. But I don't want to gripe. I don't want to fight. Let's leave that to Bats and Supes.</p> <p>So I'm setting aside my expectations, and I'm just strapping in for the ride. Just bring it on BvSâ€¦ I am so ready.</p>
