                   The battle has been fought; the dust has settled; and there is a clear winner. As much as I love DC, and as much as I wanted to love Justice League, having seen what Avengers: Infinity War accomplished, I have to admit; Marvel knows what it's doing. There's no denying they've had the hype-train to back them up nearly every time, but in this case, Infinity War is every bit worthy of the hype.

                <p>
                    Here's why I think Infinity War comes out as superior:

                    <p>Over the course of a decade, the MCU expertly teased and foreshadowed it's future characters and villains. It all snow-balled into a perfect build up, that left fans guessing and speculating as to what each tease could mean, and Infinity War was the ultimate reward.</p>

                    <p>The Justice League team members were introduced via short video clips, clearly showing each character with their abilities on display. There was absolutely nothing left to the imagination, and it all happened just a couple of movies before their own titular film. The villain got a bit of less obvious foreshadowing, thanks to some well-placed "ding ding dings" from an imprisoned Lex Luthor, and a vague warning from a future Flash.</p>

                    <p>Almost every member of the Avengers (yes, bafflingly Black Widow still doesnâ€™t have a solo film), got their own stand-alone film, giving us their own personal story arc. This allowed each of them to come together in Infinity War, without any need for exposition or explanation. We knew these characters already, and we were ready to jump straight into the action with them.</p>

                    <p>Justice League introduced us to new characters right off the bat, with no back stories. This can work for a couple of characters at most, but when almost the entire team is based on this formula, there's no real investment from the audience. It's difficult to care about a character, when we don't really know them yet. And with having to juggle multiple newbies in one film, JL never really gave us a chance to care. We were spectators watching on the side-lines as it all unfolded, versus fans rooting on our favourite heroes.</p>

                    <p>There's an obvious master plan at work within the MCU. And the confidence in the plan is evident in their unwillingness to be too flashy with it. The setting up of the Infinity Stones as the objects of interest in the film was carefully played out over multiple movies, but the stones themselves were hardly ever the focus. More often than not, they were hiding in plain sight, and the audience were more invested in the story surrounding the hero, than the stones themselves. And then we reached Infinity War, and suddenly we all felt the weight and importance of these immensely powerful objects. Even the scattering of the stones across multiple locations in the galaxy was a genius move, allowing for a neat scavenger hunt type story, and gave the film an excuse to break up the huge MCU roster into little mix and match teams that we could follow easily.</p>

                    <p>Here's an area where the MCU has faltered in before. The complaint has always been that the characters never really feel like they're in danger. Infinity War course corrected this in a huge way. Watching the film, it was apparent from the get-go that no one was safe. One wrong move could literally mean the end of life as we know it. And with every mistake and setback, we felt the weight of impending doom. Infinity War set up some massive stakes, and then committed whole-heartedly to them. </p>

                    <p>The threat in Justice League felt isolated and impersonal. DC changed it up from their previous films, which never shied away from showing realistic casualties of battle, and instead bowed to their critics, hoping to win them over. What resulted was a tepid movie, where there was never a doubt that pretty much everyone was going to make it out of this alive and well.</p>

                    <p>There's no denying that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. This was another course correction for the MCU, which, in the past, had suffered from a slew of forgettable villains, not counting Loki of course. But Thanos delivered just the right amount of backstory to let us see some depth to his actions, but maintained enough mystery that we were never really ever sure what his next move would be. Also, he felt like a real person, with emotions, complex motivations, and convictions.</p>

                    <p>MCU movies for the most part, have never really garnered much praise for stunning visuals or ambitious cinematography, and that's because they've always kept their visual effects streamlined to depict our real-world as much as possible. They always felt grounded and dare I say, even a little boring visually. But that philosophy paid off in spades for Infinity War. When your story takes place across multiple planets, and mythical locations, it can be hard to keep the audience feeling like their still watching something real. The grounded-ness of the visual effects really helped to balance things out, so that the surroundings never felt like a distraction.</p>

                   If there was one word I could use to describe Justice League, it's "hope." The movie's plot centers around this, with the direction of the film itself continuously driving home the theme of hope, future and promise. Hope even clings to each of the core characters' story arcs in some way.

                        There's plenty of excitement and joy to be found in Justice League. Some of the action scenes are truly mesmerizing to watch. The humour is gleeful and doesn't feel out of place or shoe-horned in. One of the biggest surprises for me was just how much I fell in love with Ezra Miller's version of The Flash, and I think it's safe to say he's the MVP of the movie.

                        The blistering pace of the film might make it difficult to absorb for some. But I can forgive the rapid pacing, because let's face it, this movie has a monumental task to accomplish in just two hours. It has to set up three new core characters that we need to care about and root for, while growing the team dynamic between the new members and the ones we already know. Oh, and it also has to introduce us to a brand new villain, his scheme, and set up a plan for our heroes to thwart him. Out of all these, Justice League is most successful in building the League itself. And even if all else fails, this is truly the heart of the movie. So the fact that it set up this brand new team in a believable way, is something to marvel (pardon the pun) at. The interactions between the team are without a doubt the best parts of the film.

                        However, Justice League is not without its faults. It's certainly far from a perfect movie, and as a personal fan of the artistic perfection that Zack Snyder paints each of his frames with, it was disheartening to see a film that didn't quite live up to the visual beauty that we have come to take for granted in Snyder's films. However, considering the personal tragedy and professional hurdles that the production team had to face, I can't really hold it against them. In a perfect world we would have seen the full and whole vision that Snyder had, and as fan of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I can't help but feel that a pure Snyder cut of this film would have been more satisfying for me personally. But it isn't a perfect world. Getting to see this league of heroes come together on the big screen, was a joy on its own, and I can more than live with that.

                       I've followed every bit of news (even the rumors) surrounding the production of the film leading up to its release. So it's safe to say, I went into this movie expecting to see certain things. I wasn't planning on being surprised. Boy, was I wrong. Somehow, and to their credit, Warner Brothers really managed to keep so much of this film under wraps. So even if you think you know how the story's going to go, don't be so sure. And, those post-credit scenes are fan-service at its very best.

But somehow, the movie in itself doesn't quite fulfill the promises of its predecessors. There are powerful and poignant moments in the previous films that could have served as brilliant callbacks in this one, but were left untouched. Instead, this film seems to shy away from its divisive past, and focuses solely on setting up a brighter future. For better or worse, Justice League abandons previous promises, all the while making new promises of a vibrant and exciting future that lies on the horizon for this universe. Let us 'hope', that it won't disappoint.</p>

                   In a movie that was chock-full of amazing visuals, engaging story and incredible action, it's hard to narrow down just a handful of moments to tout as the best. And yet here we are, doing the impossible. Will wonders never cease? </p>
                <p>So without further ado, and in no particular order, here are my picks for the top 5 moments in Wonder Woman:</p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	Let me start off with the most obvious one. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't absolutely love the No-man's Land sequence, and with good reason. It's an incredibly powerful moment in the film, where Diana, finally fed-up with being told that she cannot help, literally steps up to embrace her role as an active participant, rather than a passive bystander.</p>
                                    <p>Everything, from the way it's set-up, the angles it's shot with, down to the pounding score behind it, elevates this scene to one of the most epic superhero moments on film. The gravity of seeing a female superhero showcased in such mythic proportions for the first time, was emotionally powerful. This moment screams importance.</p>

                                  <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	This is a cheat moment, because it really encompasses two moments in the film. The first is on the beaches of Themyscira as the Amazons war with the German soldiers. There's an unforgettable moment where Antiope, the general of the Amazon Army, shouts "Shield!", and the Amazon nearby knows exactly what to do, using her shield to propel Antiope high above the battlefield and take down three Germans with one shot. It's a testament to the Amazons' training and skill at working together, not to mention it's just an outright bad-ass moment.</p>
                                 
                                 <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	There's an extremely satisfying call-back to this moment much later in the film, when Steve, having witnessed this move on Themyscira, mirrors it to help Diana take out a sniper in the tower of the German encampment. Not only is the move executed perfectly, it results in Diana literally annihilating the tower; the perfect finale to the extended battle that liberates the village from hostile control.</p>

                                It's rare for a summer blockbuster superhero movie to spend much time building their characters quite as deliberately as Wonder Woman does. One of those exceptional quieter character moments happens after the battle at Veld, with the villagers celebrating their freedom into the night. What starts as casual banter about dancing, turns into a wonderful intimate discussion between Diana and Steve, as they dance under a light snow-fall.

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">
                                The setting itself is beautifully romantic, but the conversation itself is what elevates the moment. The discussion of the mundane beauty of life outside of wartime,  serves as a point on the futility of war in itself, but perhaps more importantly, subtly hints at a common desire between both characters to explore the possibilities of their relationship once the war is over.

                <h4>04</h4>
                    <div class="container">
                        
                        <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">"We are all to blame"</h3>

                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.5s">
                            It's the final nail in the coffin of Diana's naivety regarding the world of mankind. It's her final realization that humans are not simply pure beacons of goodness, but can be agents of corruption and darkness all on their own. After killing General Ludendorff, and witnessing the activities of war continuing around her, Diana is confused and reaches a state of panic, as she realizes that all that she once believed in is put into question. Steve's speech to her about the harsh reality of mankind is poignant at this time. He needs her help to stop the war, but he doesn't sugar-coat reality. He tells Diana the truth. There isn't one bad guy to blame. We're all to blame. And even as Diana whispers "I'm not", Steve's reply is even more telling of his character; "but maybe I am". </p>
                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.5s">
                            Steve accepts that even he probably doesn't deserve Diana's help, and that mankind is inherently flawed, and he along with the rest. If help were dealt to merely those that deserve it, then perhaps none would really deserve help. But believing in doing the right thing to change a world full of wrongs, is more important, and it's the philosophy that stays with Diana and shapes her morality long after the war is over.

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">This statement is made almost off-hand by Hippolyta at the start of the film when she tries to convince a young Diana that war is nothing to hope for. It's a strange statement to be made in a movie that is at least partially a war-film. However, it is the final driving message of the film, that Diana herself realizes by the end. War merely breeds more war, and sometimes the greatest acts of heroism have nothing to do with fighting. This is exemplified in the heart-breaking moment when Steve courageously sacrifices himself. It's this act that spurs Diana to embrace a more optimistic outlook on mankind as a whole. </p>
                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">The double playback of his farewell to her is used powerfully to remind Diana, that not all men are selfish war-mongers. Steve isn't sacrificing himself for her, he already knows she's immune to the poisonous gas. So rather than it be some sort of epic gesture of romantic love, instead it's an act of pure selflessness for what he believes is right, giving up any future he might have had with her, in order to save thousands of nameless and faceless people. And it's this moment, when played for the second time, with the realization of what Steve had really done, that causes Diana to set aside her wrath, and show mercy to Doctor Maru, and declare that she believes in something far greater than war and judgement. </p>

                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">In the end, it's not a grand act of combat that serves as the lynchpin for the outcome of the movie, but rather a very human and very flawed person seeing beyond themselves, to make the ultimate sacrifice, thus proving to Wonder Woman that mankind is worth saving. And it allows her to shine as a beacon of hope and love, and truly be the superhero we all really need.</p>

                    As I sat in the theatre with the lights dimmed and the all new DC logo forming on the screen in front of me, the sense of sheer anticipation I was feeling is hard to describe in words. Somehow, this movie meant something more than just a movie to me. Somehow, I found myself personally invested in this, and wanting more than anything to see a movie that could live up to all my hype and aspirations for it. </p>
                <p>And it did.</p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">Wonder Woman is not just a good superhero movie; it's a great movie, period. In fact, it doesn't really feel like a superhero movie at all. It starts off as a telling of ancient mythology and fantasy, and leads into what can only be described as a war film. And war seems to be the word heard most throughout the film, and yet at every turn, we the audience know that war is not the hero of this movie. Peace, Justice and Love are the final victors of the day, and the message is carried upon the shoulders of what is clearly the best superhero to come out of the DC Extended Universe yet.</p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">I could go on and on about the cinematography, the nuanced performances, the thrilling action and the overall cohesiveness of the story as a whole. These are all executed brilliantly in the movie, no doubt. And even if all you're looking for is an entertaining and engaging film, or even just a ton of eye-candy, you'll enjoy Wonder Woman.</p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">But as a woman, watching a powerful female heroine conquering the battlefield, leading the charge, and standing for what's right; it was exhilarating. I never realized how much I wanted to feel represented in the films I watch, until I saw it done right. And Wonder Woman does it right.</p>

She <i>is</i> Wonder Woman. Sweetly innocent, extremely powerful and carrying herself with elegance and grace, Gal is nothing short of inspiring to watch. Chris Pine delivers my favourite performance of his to date, and his undeniable chemistry with Gal lays the foundation for some of the most moving moments of the film.

                                Patty Jenkins has achieved something monumental with this movie. Being the first female director to be at the helm of a film of this scale, she has undoubtedly succeeded in crafting a great piece of film-making. This will be a historic mark for female directors, and will hopefully open up more opportunities for us to see a female voice represented not just in small indie films, but also in big summer blockbusters.

                            The movie blends together a myriad of genres and tones, starting us off in realms of greek mythology on the island of Themyscira, and transitioning to the complete opposite side of the spectrum, in the harsh filth of world war one. It's a vivid contrast in atmosphere, but the movie handles it well. It perfectly combines epic action, with poignant emotional moments, dashes of sincere humor that doesn't feel forced, and compelling character growth. I was half-expecting them to avoid romance in the movie, merely as a way to subvert any clichÃ©s of the genre, but even that aspect is handled tastefully and feels completely believable and honest in the context of the story.</p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">A note on the humour; superhero movies as of late seem to be trying their hardest to make us laugh. And if you've been paying attention, you'd have noticed that it's starting to beat the audience over the head with it. DC as a whole seems to have avoided that approach with DCEU, but when Wonder Woman was touted as being lighter and more humourous movie, I had trepidations that it would have been too "marvel-ized". But as a credit to the screenwriters, the movie's laughs feel completely natural in the narrative, and the comedy weaves itself seamlessly into the story.

                            As the credits rolled, and the closing soundtrack soared, I had to sit in my seat for awhile before I was ready to leave the theatre. I felt moved, hopeful and optimistic. I felt inspired and uplifted. I wanted to immediately watch the film all over again. And funnily enough, at that moment, I wished I had a daughter whom I could show this film to, and tell her that superheroes can look like her. I truly think this movie will have a lasting resonance and impact in years to come, and while it is a great film, it's also an important film for a generation of movie-goers. The thing is, Wonder Woman is what we've been waiting for and so much more.

                    With every glimpse into the upcoming Wonder Woman movie, there's a collective thrum of anticipation for what's to come. Could this finally be a female superhero movie that could supersede that classification? Could it just be a great superhero movie, or better yet, could it just be a great movie? I think it will be. </p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.4s">Zack Snyder's unique vision for the DCEU has included incredible character designs for our favourite heroes. He's succeeded in making them stand above the world around them, Gods among men, and Wonder Woman more so than others.</p>
                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.5s">Her first-ever character poster was met with some scepticism due to the dull tones and monochromatic color-correction. But once we saw it in action in Batman v Superman, all doubts were tabled. Even though her armour was a lot more muted in comparison to the comics, it made sense for the narrative context in terms of it being centuries old. When the posters for the Wonder Woman movie were released, we got an even better look at that iconic costume in it's true glory. </p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">They embraced the vibrant hues, and showed off the deep reds and blues that harken back to her original comic look, without being gaudy or overdone. The overall design of her costume is based around greek armour, and expertly walks that fine-line between femininity and ferocity. And while it is a substantially revealing outfit as a whole, somehow she doesn't look overly-sexualized as she has often been in the comics.
                                    </p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s"> Giving us a version of Wonder Woman that stays true to her comic roots, while updating her for our time, and still keeps her looking timeless, is a feat to be applauded. Wonder Woman's character design could have easily veered into gratuitous or silly territory, but it ends up being undoubtedly powerful and undoubtedly beautiful.

                            <p>When Gal Gadot was cast as the world's most famous female superhero, the internet had a collective meltdown. One criticism was due to her being too much of a new-comer to carry such a weighty role. But annoyingly, the loudest criticism was around her physical appearance. Fans argued that she wasn't, as she so sweetly put it, "big-hearted" enough for the role of Wonder Woman, who was generally portrayed as a buxom female with her costume barely managing to contain her curves. Those arguments have all since been quelled, after Gal managed to steal the show from two of the greatest superheroes in history in their own movie no less, even with very little screen-time.</p>

                            <p>Her embodiment of the character both on and off screen has been apparent. She exudes charisma and sophistication, and yet she's not afraid to be goofy and there's just something so entirely relatable about her. More than anything, she's proved that regardless of your physicality or others' expectations of you, how you carry yourself as an individual will be what matters in the end. She's brought a whole new dimension to a 75 year-old character, and for that, Gal, we salute you!</p>

                                Having a female director be at the helm of the first live-action Wonder Woman movie is an important place to start. To have a director with the talent and gravitas that Patty Jenkins brings to the table, is an even bigger asset to the movie. Not only is she an award-winning film-maker, but hearing her talk about the project with such affection and warmth, makes it evident that she is as ardent a fan as any. A perfect blend of talent and passion is exactly what this movie needs to go beyond being good, and be great.

                            The movie's taglines reveal the over-arcing themes of this character; someone who is undeniably powerful, and  someone who cares deeply about making a difference that matters. Wonder Woman brings a unique perspective of Justice and Wisdom that juxtaposes mankind's incessant obsession with needless violence. She vows to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. She may not be the hero we deserve, but she's the hero we need. </p>

Just for starters, having him in the film at all is a big plus, since he's super talented and irresistibly likeable in all of his movies. Add on to that the chemistry between him and Gal, along with his witty quips, and Chris will no doubt be the comic highlight of the movie. Throw in names like Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Lucy Davis and Connie Nielson, and it's plain to see that Wonder Woman has a cast that's oozing with talent.</p>

                                        As promotional material has revealed thus far, the movie will visit various settings, from the breath-taking paradise isle of Thymescira, to the muddy trenches of World War 1. It introduces Diana to a world where women weren't particularly deemed on par with men in their society. Her unique worldview contrasting with the ideas of that era, will certainly prove to be comical as well as thought-provoking. And beyond that, this movie just looks amazing.

There's sure to be at least a couple that are on everyone's radar, but with such a vast array of movies coming up, it's easy to miss out on a few. So for easy reference, here are some of the upcoming movie releases in 2017 that ooze potential, and have our curiosities piqued. <br/>(Note: This is not a comprehensive list, just some of the ones that I'm personally anticipating.)</p>

            <p class="release">2 June 2017</p>
            <p class="level">01</p>
            <span>My number 1 most anticipated movie of the year. Gal Gadot headlines the first standalone female superhero movie of the current era. The weight of the future of the DCEU rests on her shoulders, but I believe Wonder Woman will achieve the greatness she deserves. </span>

            <p class="level">02</p>
            <span>Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Green Lanternâ€¦ the list goes on. Probably the greatest collection of superheroes to ever be assembled in one movie, Justice League would really have to work a miracle to not be entertaining.

            <p class="level">03</p>
            <span>Supposedly Hugh Jackman's last outing as everyone's favourite mutant, Wolverine returns to the big-screen with a very different kind of superhero movie. The tone looks grim, and decidedly violent, but intermixed with drama and heavy emotional undertones. Also keep an eye out for the introduction of the next incarnation of Wolverine.

            <p class="level">14</p>
            <span>A harrowing look at the horrors of war through the lense of Christopher Nolan, director of the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. If you're a fan of Saving Private Ryan, something tells me, you're going to be a fan of Dunkirk as well.

            <span>The next chapter in the Alien saga, with director Ridley Scott returning to the helm, Alien Covenant looks to deliver a quality sci-fi horror movie, as it continuing the story introduced in Prometheus.

            <span>Thor vs The Hulk. We got a slight taste of it in The Avengers, but get ready to see it on a whole new level, when the two goliaths face-off gladiator style, in what's sure to be a crazy, action-packed movie. I don't know how they're gonna pull it off, but I'm definitely curious to see them try.</span>

            <p class="level">06</p>
            <span>The Skywalker Chronicles continue! It doesn't take a lot of convincing to get on board with the latest episode of Star Wars, especially coming on the heels of the triumphant Rogue One. More Luke Skywalker, can only mean good things. It will also likely be the last time we see Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia, so it will certainly be an emotional day at the theatre.

            <p class="level">21</p>
            <span>A somewhat quirky-looking sci-fi adventure, with a ton of incredible visuals, I don't know much about Valerian, but I'm curious to learn more. Can Cara Delevingne finally prove once and for all that she's a legitimate actress, and help us all forget that awful dancey performance in Suicide Squad?</span>

            <p class="release">3 February 2017</p>
            <p class="level">26</p>
            <span>Imagine discovering the world for the very first time as a teenager. The Space Between Us has the interesting premise, of a boy, born on a space station on Mars, away from almost all human contact. As he journeys to Earth for the first time, the film explores new encounters, falling in love, and discovering your place in the world. </span>

            <p class="level">12</p>
            <span>Repeating the same day over and over again is hardly a new premise for a movie. But Before I Fall isn't a flashy sci-fi action blockbuster. It's a quiet indie film, where one girl, while in the process of being doomed to repeat the same day again and again, must discover how even the smallest, most mundane moments can shape the course of the future, and to make every second count.</span>

            <p class="level">15</p>
            <span>King Kong is back! And he's bigger than ever! Kong Skull Island will take us back to the 80s where we'll be introduced to the biggest incarnation of King Kong that we've seen yet. Why is he so big? Because, if all goes well, he'll be battling Godzilla on the big screen in the not too distant future. Also, the movie stars Tom Hiddleston, so that should be enough of a draw.

            <p class="level">05</p>
            <span>Yet another reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this time with Marvel onboard. While we should all be sorely tired of seeing yet another new iteration of the character, Spiderman Homecoming managed to do the impossible; it actually got me excited for it, with a charming and entertaining trailer, that somehow breathed new life into the character.

            <span>Emma Watson and Dan Stevens bring the animated classic to life. Even if you've never seen the original animated Disney flick, the beautiful visuals, enchanting music, and a chance to see Hermione as Belle, is reason enough to look forward to Beauty and the Beast.

            <p class="release">10 February 2017</p>
            <p class="level">16</p>
            <span>Just when we'd all settled on Batman as the darkest, most serious superhero ever, here comes the Lego Batman Movie, to show us a completely different take on the Dark Knight. The trailers have been hilarious, poking fun at the stoic and dark nature of the character, with even a little jab at Batman v Superman. It looks to be a fun and entertaining movie going experience.

            <p class="level">10</p>
            <span>This brand new iteration of the Power Rangers seems to be oozing with cheese, but when you're talking about 5 teens who dress up in colourful super suits and fight monsters, it's pretty hard to avoid cheesiness. If you're willing to forgive the campiness, it just might be a fun call-back to your childhood. The special effects look cool enough.

            <p class="level">09</p>
            <span>The first Kingsman movie was a wildly entertaining action film. With tons of fun parodies of typical spy genre tropes, along with some truly spectacular action scenes, it was a standout movie. If this sequel can be even half as entertaining as its predecessor, then count me in. Manners maketh a man!

            <p class="level">22</p>
            <span>Forget the goofy action comedy of the last decade. This is a reboot of the franchise, with Tom Cruise along for the ride. Will it be Mission Impossible with Mummies? Perhaps. But how could that possibly be a bad thing. Also, this time we'll be dealing with a female version of the monster.

            <span>Charlie Hunnam stars as the titular character in this origin-story of sorts. It doesn't look like any Arthurian tale we've ever seen before, and considering that this is from Guy Richie, the director of the Sherlock Holmes films and last year's criminally underrated Man from UNCLE, King Arthur Legend of the Sword looks to a movie worth seeing.

            <span>Any movie with Emma Watson has my attention. Throw in a plot of a nefarious Tech company that seems to be crossing the line of user privacy, the movie looks to be a timely exploration of some of the issues our society is facing today.</span>

            <p class="level">30</p>
            <span>Scarlette Johanson stars in Ghost in the Shell, a science-fiction movie adapted from a famous Japanese Manga of the same name. I'm not familiar with the original property, but the visuals look stunning, and the cinematic universe explored in the movie, seems intriguing enough to give it a watch.

            <p class="level">28</p>
            <span>The Belko Experiment is one of those movies that makes you question, "what would you do if you were in that situation?" It's a horrifying premise, being trapped with your co-workers and being told to choose who lives and dies. It's sure to raise questions of morality vs survival, and it has Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn at the helm.</span>

            <span>Chris Evans takes a break from being everyone's favourite Captain, to play a young man raising his niece who is a child-prodigy. It's nice to see Chris Evans outside of an action role, and Gifted looks to be a touching and heart-warming tale of redemption, trust and family.</span>

            <span>The Pirates franchise doesn't quite excite us like it used to, but there's hope for Dead Men Tell No Tales, as it sees the return of Orlando Bloom, and hopefully a return to a tighter storyline focusing on characters we care about. And of course, Jack Sparrow is back, so at the very least, we'll see some hilarious antics.</span>

            <span>Ryand Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal play astronauts on a space mission to Mars, where they discover evidence of extra-terrestrial life that isn't altogether friendly. Alien life threatening a space-crew isn't exactly a novel concept, but the trailer and the cast involved make this a movie worth getting excited about.</span>

            <p class="level">14</p>
            <span>If Dunkirk is a little too intense for you, Their Finest examines World War 2 through a different perspective. A female screen-writer in a British film crew, must overcome stereotypes to do her part to help in the war. Though set in a difficult period, the film presents a heart-warming and comedic story, with charming performances by Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin and Bill Nighy.</span>

            <span>If you like your period dramas with a darker flavour than typical Jane Austen-fare, then My Cousin Rachel looks to be right up your alley. Based on the popular Daphne Du Maurier novel, the film stars Sam Claflin and Rachel Weiz in a mysterious and twisted love affair. I haven't read the novel, but the trailer alone has me curious about this story.</span>

            <span>The Lost City of Z revolves around the real-life story of a British explorer on his search for a forgotten city in the depths of the amazon. The movie looks to blend adventure with the eeriness of the unknown, and stars Carlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson, who just happens to be sporting a glorious beard. Uncharted territory indeed.</span>

                    Rogue One is exactly what its subtitle suggests; a story based in the Star Wars universe. It sits between Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) and Episode IV (A New Hope). In fact, it literally tells the story of the first couple of lines in the Opening Crawl of Episode IV.</p>

                <p>In summary, Rogue One is the tale of rag-tag members of a fledgling Rebel Alliance coming together to steal the plans to the Galactic Empire's superweapon, The Deathstar. It acts as the launching pad for the events that lead to the final take-down of Empire, and fleshes out the entire Star Wars universe in a very satisfying way. Indeed it's a brilliant achievement on the part of this film, that it takes one line of exposition, and turns it into a well-rounded and entertaining story.</p>

                            While the movie centers on the rebels, the primary focus rests on Jyn Erso, played by a quietly strong Felicity Jones, a young woman who is haunted by her family's connection to the Empire. She is supported by strong performances from Diego Luna as Captain Cassian Andor, Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe and Ben Mendelsohn as the deliciously villainous Orson Krennic. There are many other famous faces and engaging performances scattered throughout the film, and as a whole the cast gels well together to bring us, what is easily, the most diverse Star Wars movie we have ever seen.

                            The action is well choreographed, and feels dangerous. In an age where nearly every action movie borrows from the school of Jason Bourne's quick-cut mayhem, it's wonderful to see the action through steady, long-held camera shots. It allows us to truly appreciate each moment of choreography. Donnie Yen especially lends a sense of believability to his action scenes, as he obviously knows what he's doing. The movie as a whole divides its action into two halves, where the first hour of the film has more close-quartered action, while the final hour moves to a grander scale with epic space battles. Both are handled exceptionally well.</p>

                        <p>
                            The great thing about Rogue One is that you can go in as a complete Star Wars noob, and still have a fairly enjoyable movie-going experience, because it stands on its own as a well-constructed story. But if you're familiar with Star Wars lore, and if you've watched the previous movies, you're going to be positively gleeful. It has numerous appearances by familiar faces throughout the Star Wars anthology, and it perfectly bridges together the Prequels with the Original Trilogy. While Hollywood has been overrun with sequels/prequels/reboots that all try their best to play on our nostalgia, Rogue One has done it the best so far. Beyond merely referencing an existing franchise, it actually builds on it and improves it.</p>

                           If you've seen the trailer, then it should come as no surprise to you that Darth Vader makes an appearance in this movie. He's not in it extensively, but his presence is definitely felt in a powerful way. No spoilers, but there's a scene towards the end of the movie involving Lord Vader that was simply breath-taking. I've been a casual Star Wars fan for a long time, and I've watched every movie in the series, but I never really understood why Darth Vader was often considered the number 1 villain in movie history. I never really understood the menace or fear that the characters in the movies seemed to feel in his presence. That was until I saw Rogue One. Once you see the movie, you'll understand.

                            Rogue One is action-packed, engaging and thoroughly entertaining. Some viewers might find the first half of the movie a little slow-moving, but the pay-off at the end is well-worth it.  I'm going to say something a little controversial here; but understand that I didn't grow up with the original trilogy and I found the prequels somewhat lacking. Episode VII: The Force Awakens was a fun ride and I definitely enjoyed it. But the thing is Rogue One just might be my favourite Star Wars movie.

                    Movies based on Video Games have established a well-proven stereotype; shallow, campy, over-the-top and almost always, disappointing. They've ranged from low-budget cheesiness like Mortal Kombat, to big-budget star-driven wanna-be epics like Prince of Persia. </p>
                <p>
                    Warcraft had every chance to follow in those exact same footsteps, and when initially presented with its world, it may seem like more of the same shallow, effects-driven fan-service that we've seen before. But after seeing the movie, I'm extremely happy to conclude that this was without a doubt, the best Video Game Movie that I have seen thus far. </p>

                            As a precursor, I admit that I haven't played the World of Warcraft game, that the movie is based off of. I have however played Warcraft 3, the real-time strategy incarnation of the game. The characters in this movie were all new to me, so I didn't have much fore-knowledge going into the movie.</p>

                            Warcraft tells the story of a first encounter between two very different civilizations; the Orcs and Humans. Each race has its own dynamics and culture, which are very much at odds with each other, which in turn sparks a war. The Orcs are the instigators, while the Humans are merely reactionary.</p>
                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">
                            In these instances, we're mostly used to seeing stories told from the Human perspective. If there's an Alien Invasion, it's from the Human perspective. If there's a battle against some supernatural force, it's from the Human perspective. Even prior fantasy stories, such as Lord of the Rings are mostly based around the perspective of human or human-like races. In fact, we've gotten pretty used to seeing Orcs as mindless beasts who are only interested in death and destruction. </p>

                            Warcraft breaks this trend, by making the Orcs the most compelling characters onscreen. They have internal conflicts, wavering loyalties, intricate tribal traditions and hierarchies, and a deep sense of honour. They do reign a fair amount of chaos on the Human world, leaving destruction in their wake, but no one could accuse these creatures of being unthinking beasts. Even the introduction to our primary Orc protagonist, war-chieftain Durotan, is by his pregnant wife's side, as they playfully discuss their future child. This paints a very different picture from the Orcs that we've grown accustomed to seeing, and it is truly refreshing.</p>

                            The majority of the character development throughout the movie remains with the Orcs. There are moments where we delve into the human characters and get a glimpse of their own histories and motivations, but this is minimal and can sometimes even seem a little flat in comparison.</p>
                        <p>This movie is really about the story of Durotan and his people's journey to find a home. I wonder if the majority of the criticism that has been levelled at this movie is due to the fact that the usual "heroes" are less compelling than the brutish creatures. This is a fresh take on Fantasy, and the Video Game movie genre as a whole, so I found myself pleasantly surprised.</p>

                            It would do this film a great disservice if I didn't mention the epic, yes absolutely EPIC battle sequences it depicts. Director Duncan Jones expertly captures the action up-close without it ever feeling muddled or confusing. You feel the weight of every hammer's fall, and the sharpness of each sword. The action scenes were exceedingly entertaining, and sometimes I found myself even cringing whenever a particularly heavy blow would fall. It felt like being in the middle of the fight, and even if you see this movie just for the action, I believe it would be time well-spent.</p>

                    <p>A note on Paula Patton's character, Garona, a half-breed Orc character; throughout the marketing campaign for the movie, she was shown in Orc garb, which was quite revealing, while she struck a provocative pose. Now I understand that the target audience of this movie is primarily made up of the younger male demographic, so Hollywood was just being Hollywood by marketing her character that way. It's an annoying aspect of the entertainment industry in general, but it is what it is.  As I watched the movie however, I was pleasantly surprised to see that as the story progressed, Garona became more "clothed" if I could use that term. Her character wasn't just eye-candy. She got full-bodied armour, she fought viciously in battle, she integrated into a new society, and she dealt with several emotional storylines. The final act of the movie even hinted that she may have an even more important role to play should the series continue in the future. All in all, it was exceedingly refreshing to see an intelligent portrayal of a female character in a video game movie.</p>

                            The sceneries and environment are expansive and breath-taking. It often feels surreal; like a painting brought to life. This feeling invades the whole look of the movie, where it may feel like you are in the middle of a Video Game rather than a traditional movie environment. Movies tend to always lean towards some sense realism, even when depicting Fantasy worlds. But Warcraft lets go of realism, and fully embraces the largeness of its universe. It could have easily been quite cheesy, but Duncan Jones handles it with such finesse that keeps it within a sense of wonderment, rather than incredulity.</p>

                    All in all, Warcraft deals with the traditional notions of Light vs Darkness, Good vs Evil, Tradition vs New-Thinking. It also explores deeper themes of loyalty, friendship, bravery and finding one's place in the world. The film boasts fantastic special effects, and the motion capture work on the Orcs is remarkable. It breaks norms, in making the "ugly beasts" the main focus of the film, and gives its characters intelligent and compelling story arcs. So despite what the majority of film critics seem to think, the thing is, Warcraft is the best Video Game Movie thus far, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p><span class="emph">The Lord of The Rings</span> by J R R Tolkein, is widely considered to be one of the greatest works of Fantasy Literature ever written; and for good reason. It spans a rich and expansive world, and offers a story that is altogether epic in scope but deeply personal in its telling. Within this world, there are many characters explored, each championing the cause of their side; and as with all great stories, there is a hero to be found.</p>

                    <p>A character like Aragorn certainly seems primed to be the ultimate vehicle of heroism. But even he is not introduced as a confident and established hero, but as a grimy and weatherworn Ranger. Beneath the mud and grime however, is a leader of men and the heir to the throne of Gondor. Aragorn struggles with self-doubt, but eventually overcomes his insecurities to claim his destiny as a great warrior, leading a great host against the enemy, and finally being crowned as king. By all means, this is the Hero's journey that we have come to expect.</p>
                    <p>
                        But anyone who has delved into the Lord of the Rings, would probably not point to Aragorn as the primary Hero of the tale. He certainly is one of the many heroes in the series, yet somehow, despite being the quintessential personification of heroism, it is the characters that surprise us that seem to have the greater impact in the course of the story.

                        The Unexpected Hero is a recurring theme in The Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien begins this with Frodo Baggins. Much is made of a simple hobbit being chosen as the Ring Bearer, amidst the presence of warriors, wizards and wise men. Frodo never sees himself playing a large or even significant role, merely a temporary steward of the Ring until stronger and wiser folk can take over. And yet it is he that becomes the bearer of the greatest burden, precisely because of his humility and unassuming nature. It harkens to the famous adage that perhaps the greatest Heroes are the ones that do not pursue its glories.

                        Once Frodo becomes the Ring Bearer, we settle in for a charming story of how our brave little Hobbit will overcome his trials to defeat the evil forces that surround him and triumph as the ultimate Hero. We are now one step into the Unexpected Hero theme. But as the plot progresses, events do not unfold the way we expect. Despite being pure-hearted and good-intentioned, Frodo progressively crumbles under the burden of being the Ring Bearer. Despite being essentially our main protagonist, by the latter-end of the tale, he makes unwise decisions, treats Sam unfairly, is undiscerning of Gollum's treachery, and finally is unable to resist the temptation of the One Ring, succumbing to his desire and deciding to hold on to it instead of destroying it. That, is certainly not heroic. Now we are pulled in one step deeper into the twist of the Unexpected Hero. As Frodo steadily shrinks in heroism, Tolkien introduces to us another.

                        Samwise Gamgee is presented to us as the "stupid, fat hobbit". The sidekick to the story. At least, an insignificant companion to the Fellowship, and at best, a support system for our main protagonist. He certainly doesn't fit the bill of a Hero, and we never expect him to be one. But by the end of the story, it is indeed Sam who emerges as the Hero. It is Sam who wades into the river to follow his master into Mordor, refusing to let him go alone. Sam, who sacrifices his rations for Frodo's sake, going hungry at times during their difficult journey. Sam, who remains loyal to their friendship despite the seeds of discord sown by Gollum. Sam, who faces his fears and risks everything to fight the monstrous spider, Shelob, and confronts a band of Orcs to rescue Frodo. And in perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of the tale, it is Sam who carries his friend up the side of Mount Doom, when Frodo has lost all will.

                        Other characters hold true to this theme as well. Merry and Pippin are introduced as mischief-makers, and the comic relief of the series. However, by the end, Merry has ridden into battle with the army of Rohan, and bravely stabs the Lord of the NazgÃ»l, thus enabling Eowyn to vanquish him. And Pippin has gone from being an incessant annoyance, and the thorn in Gandalf's side, to being a Guard of the Citadel of Gondor, helping Gandalf to save Faramir's life from the insanity of his father and even fighting in the army during the final assault on the Gates of Mordor. Eowyn is presented as a shieldmaiden of Rohan, constantly left behind as the men of her kingdom ride to battle, and seemingly relegated to being an unfortunate and rejected love-interest for Aragorn. But she rises above these circumstances to fight in the battle of the Pelennor Fields, and finally defeat the Witch King of Angmar, doing what even Aragorn and Gandalf could not do.</p>

                    <p>Tolkien births an important idea in our minds; that a Hero does not always begin his journey as one. It teaches us to remember that even if our own story thus far has seemed insignificant and disappointing, there is coming a time when we may rise above it. Some may walk the path of heroism their whole life, and be exactly what we expect. </p>

                        <p>The one thing that you must know, when going in to see Disney's latest movie, The Jungle Book, is that 95% of what you see is entirely computer generated. The reason you should know this going in, is because 5 minutes into the film, you're going to completely forget that fact. And that is precisely what makes this a movie worth watching.</p>

                        <h2>Story</h2>
                        <p>As far as story goes, there isn't a lot that's going on. The plot follows Mowgli as he makes the journey across the jungle on his quest to reach the "man village." Along the way he crosses a myriad of environments and encounters various wildlife, some friendly, and some not so much. The overall story arc is quite predictable, and delivers pretty much the plot you would expect. Good triumphs over evil of course, our main protagonist being the beacon of hope and the voice that rallies everyone together. </p>

                        <p>Despite this however, the movie manages to keep its viewer engaged, not so much because we are ever in suspense as to whether Mowgli will eventually triumph, but because we are so invested in the environment and the captivating world that we see. We care about Mowgli, and more impressively, the movie makes us care about the CGI animals as well.

                            <p>CGI Technology continues to make impressive leaps and bounds in creating worlds that do not exist and making them wholly believable to viewers. This is often easier when the world being created is something of fantasy and science-fiction, an alien world or a mythical creature. But when CGI can authentically mimic things that we are essentially familiar with, then it deserves special praise. This is the case in The Jungle Book. Although the idea of talking animals and a human child living alongside them and communicating with them is a branch of fantasy, the appearance, movements and behaviour of the animals are all based upon reality.

                    <p  data-scroll-reveal="enter from the left after 0.2s">While the CGI Animators deserve high praise for the authenticity of the world that is presented in the movie, the burden of driving the emotional connection we feel to it, is borne almost entirely by the young star of the movie, Neel Sethi. He makes the difference of it not being merely a visually stunning and believable environment, but one that we get emotionally invested in, with characters that we care about. It certainly is an impressive feat when you consider that this is his first feature film and he was a mere 10 years old during filming. His acting is mostly convincing, and never exaggerated, and any moments where it is evident that he is acting are easily forgiven when the camera catches his deep engaging gaze. Also, it doesn't hurt that he is incredibly adorable and feels like the mischievous little brother we all wish we had.</p>

                        The movie also boasts a powerhouse voice-acting cast; of these the most recognizable voices provided by Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong'o, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken. Bill Murray especially shines as the lovable Baloo and steals the show whenever he's on screen (or should I say, whenever his voice is heard). The comedy is ever present, while being grounded somewhat to make it more believable, but anyone would be hard-pressed to not immediately fall in love with that silly bear. Scarlet Johansson is also quite notable, and despite having a smaller role, completely consumes the screen time as the sinister snake Kaa. Idris Elba also delivers a commanding performance as the fearsome tiger Shere Khan.

            There's a great tension in the deeper story of The Jungle Book, especially in terms of the character motivations. There are compelling themes of family and friendship, but I found a more complex theme behind Shere Khan's motivations. There is no doubt that he is the essential antagonist of the story, and painted on the surface as the typical villain. But upon reflection, one has to wonder whether his qualms about Mowgli were not unfounded. His prior experience with man has been as that of an invader and a disruptor of the natural way of the jungle. Man brings with him the "red flower", fire that destroys everything it touches. In fact, all the animals of the jungle fear it for this very reason, and so rightly they should. </p>

            <p  data-scroll-reveal="enter from the left after 0.2s">This is a tension we see in our own world, where nature has suffered much at the hands of human-beings. So Shere Khan is almost justified in his motivations, if not his actions. In the end, even while Mowgli tries to stand up to the tiger's tyranny using fire, he ends up causing destruction despite his best efforts. It raises an interesting question as to whether man can ever truly co-exist peacefully with Nature, without inadvertently causing its ruin.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Jungle Book is a thrilling adventure film, which captivates its audience with stunning environments, amazing renderings of nature and compelling characters. The story is nothing new and won't deliver much in terms of surprises and plot twists, but The Thing is, the movie still manages to engage its viewers right to the end based on the strength of its incredible visual effects and effective performances.
