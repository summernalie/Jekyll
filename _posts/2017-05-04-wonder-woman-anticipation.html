                    With every glimpse into the upcoming Wonder Woman movie, I can't help but be beside myself with excitement for what's to come. Could this finally be a female superhero movie that could supersede that classification? Could it just be a great superhero movie, or better yet, could it just be a great movie? I think it will be. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading text-center">And here's why:</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row" data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">

                            <h2>01. Timely and Timeless Character Design</h2>
                            <p>Zack Snyder's unique vision for the DCEU has included incredible character designs for our favourite heroes. He's succeeded in making them stand above the world around them, and Wonder Woman more so than others.</p>
                            <p>Her first-ever character poster was met with some scepticism due to the dull tones and monochromatic color-correction. But once we saw it in action in BvS, all doubts were tabled. Even though her armour seemed a lot more muted in term of color, it made sense for the narrative context in terms of it being centuries old. When the posters for the Wonder Woman movie were released, we got an even better look at that iconic costume in it's true glory. </p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img src="assets/img/ww/bvs-ww.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img src="assets/img/ww/ww-bright.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left" />
                                </div>

                                    <p>They embraced the vibrant hues, and showed off the deep reds and blues that harken back to her original comic look, without being gaudy or overdone. The overall design of her costume is based around greek armour, and expertly walks that fine-line between femininity and ferocity. And while it is a substantially revealing outfit as a whole, somehow she doesn't look overly-sexualized as she has often been in the comics.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p> Giving us a version of Wonder Woman that stays true to her comic roots, while updating her for our time, and still keeps her looking timeless, is a feat to be applauded. Wonder Woman's character design could have easily veered into gratuitous or silly territory, but it ends up being undoubtedly powerful and undoubtedly feminine.

                        <h2>02. Gal Gadot</h2>
                        <p>When Gal Gadot was cast as the world's most famous female superhero, the internet had a collective meltdown. One criticism was due to her being too much of a new-comer to carry such a weighty role. But annoyingly, the loudest criticism was around her body-shape. Fan-boys argues that she wasn't, as she so sweetly put it, "big-hearted" enough for the role of Wonder Woman, who was generally portrayed as a buxom female with her costume barely managing to contain her curves. Those arguments have all since been quelled, after Gal managed to steal the show from two of the greatest superheroes in history in their own movie no less, even with very little screen-time. Her embodiment of the character while on and off screen has been commendable. She exudes charisma and sophistication, and yet there's just something so entirely relatable about her. And more than anything, she's proved that regardless of your physicality or other's expectations of you, how you carry yourself as an individual will be what matters in the end. She's brought a whole new dimension to a 75 year-old character, and for that, Gal, we salute you!</p>

                                Having a female director be at the helm of the first live-action Wonder Woman movie is an important place to start. To have a director with the talent and gravitas as Patty Jenkins is an incredible asset to the movie. Not only is she an award-winning film-maker, but hearing her talk about the project with such affection and warmth, makes it evident that she is as ardent a fan as any. A perfect blend of talent and passion is exactly what this movie needs to go beyond being good, and be great.

                            <p>
                                As promotional material for the movie has revealed thus far, Wonder Woman takes place during World War 1. It's an era that superhero movies haven't visited before, and it provides a unique setting for Wonder Woman to enter man's world. The movie serves as an origin story, which will definitely help to educate movie-goers who are new to her character, while satisfying her legions of fans that have waited decades to see her story brought to the big screen.

                            <h2>06. Chris Pine and supporting cast</h2>
                            <p>Chris Pine plays the role of Steve Trevor, Wonder Woman's love interest in the film. Just having him in the film as any character would have been a plus, since he's an extremely charming and likeable presence in all his movies, but especially seeing the chemistry between him and Gal, and allowing them to riff off of each other will provide a lighter touch to contrast the darker themes in the movie, and will definitely elevate the movie as a whole. Throw in names like Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Lucy Davis and Connie Nielson, and it's plain to see that Wonder Woman has no shortage of talented actors..</p>
