                   In a movie that was chock-full of amazing visuals, engaging story and incredible action, it's hard to narrow down just a handful of moments to tout as the best. And yet here we are, doing the impossible. Will wonders never cease? </p>
                <p>So without further ado, and in no particular order, here are my picks for the top 5 moments in Wonder Woman:</p>
            </div>
                
        </section>
        <section id="points" class="">
            <div class="point" id="point1">
                <div class="overlay"></div>
                <h4>01</h4>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">"This is No-man's Land"</h3>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-12">
                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">Let me start off with the most obvious one. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't absolutely love the No-man's Land sequence, and with good reason. It's an incredibly powerful moment in the film, where Diana, finally fed-up with being told that she cannot help, literally steps up to embrace her role as an active participant, rather than a passive bystander.</p>
                                    <p>Everything, from the way it's set-up, the angles it's shot with, down to the pounding score behind it, elevates this scene to one of the most epic superhero moments on film. The gravity of seeing a female superhero showcased in such mythic proportions for the first time, made me, and certainly countless others overcome with emotion. This moment screams importance and epicness.</p>

                <h4>02</h4>
                    <div class="container">

                                 <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">"Shield!"</h3>
                                  <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">This is a cheat moment, because it really encompasses two moments in the film. The first is on the beaches of Themyscira as the Amazons war with the German soldiers, there's an unforgettable moment where Antiope, the general of the Amazon Army, shouts "Shield!"

                                Patty Jenkins has achieved something monumental with this movie. Being the first female director to be at the helm of a film of this scale, she has undoubtedly succeeded in crafting a great piece of film-making. This will be a historic mark for female directors, and will hopefully open up more opportunities for us to see a female voice represented not just in small indie films, but also in big summer blockbusters.

                            The movie blends together a myriad of genres and tones, starting us off in realms of greek mythology on the island of Themyscira, and transitioning to the complete opposite side of the spectrum, in the harsh filth of world war one. It's a vivid contrast in atmosphere, but the movie handles it well. It perfectly combines epic action, with poignant emotional moments, dashes of sincere humor that doesn't feel forced, and compelling character growth. I was half-expecting them to avoid romance in the movie, merely as a way to subvert any clich√©s of the genre, but even that aspect is handled tastefully and feels completely believable and honest in the context of the story.</p>

                            <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">"Maybe we're all to blame"</h3>
                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">A note on the humour; superhero movies as of late seem to be trying their hardest to make us laugh. And if you've been paying attention, you'd have noticed that it's starting to beat the audience over the head with it. DC as a whole seems to have avoided that approach with DCEU, but when Wonder Woman was touted as being lighter and more humourous movie, I had trepidations that it would have been too "marvel-ized". But as a credit to the screenwriters, the movie's laughs feel completely natural in the narrative, and the comedy weaves itself seamlessly into the story.

                            As the credits rolled, and the closing soundtrack soared, I had to sit in my seat for awhile before I was ready to leave the theatre. I felt moved, hopeful and optimistic. I felt inspired and uplifted. I wanted to immediately watch the film all over again. And funnily enough, at that moment, I wished I had a daughter whom I could show this film to, and tell her that superheroes can look like her. I truly think this movie will have a lasting resonance and impact in years to come, and while it is a great film, it's also an important film for a generation of movie-goers. The thing is, Wonder Woman is what we've been waiting for and so much more.
